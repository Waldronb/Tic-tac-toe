# Tic-tac-toe
Basic game needs refinement. I built this game as part of learning Python. It follows the basics of the game tic tac toe. 
Two players play on the same terminal. They rotate turns and the boad updates after every selection. The game either wins when
one of the players get 3 in a row, or the board becomes filled up. Some things I need to do still are. Make sure once a space
is selected the opposing player cannot target that same space. Also, find a better way to display than just the terminal that 
"refreshes" by spamming newline characters. I plan on refining this simple game as my skills progress. 


# Requirements:
This runs on Python 3. Which can be downloaded at python.org version 3.6 or newest available.
